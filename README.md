This is my first project in React. The aim is to combine my desire to become junior frontend developer and my ultramarathon bike hobby.
To achieve the goal I came up with an idea of creating web site where you can fast and easily prepare training plan for such a long ride.
I started the project using create-react-app and json-server in order to make the begginnig a little bit easier.
I am aware of many parts of te project which need improving, but this is due to the fact that during making it I was learning by testing various solutions.

As ultramarathon is ma passion and I keen on developing my frontend skills, I keep on working on the project.

Hope you enjoy it!
